# UX Improvements - Queue Page

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Removed Progress Bar

**Problem**: The progress bar was misleading because the OpenAI Sora API doesn't provide progress information. It just showed a pulsing animation that didn't reflect actual progress.

**Solution**: Removed the progress bar completely. Users now see:
- **Queued**: Job is waiting in OpenAI's queue
- **Running**: Job is being processed (no fake progress)
- **Succeeded**: Video is ready and displayed

### 2. ✅ Show Video Immediately in Queue

**Problem**: When a video completed, users had to navigate to the Library page to watch it. This broke the flow and wasn't intuitive.

**Solution**: Completed videos now display directly in the Queue page with:
- ✅ Full video player with controls
- ✅ Auto-play and loop
- ✅ File name and size displayed
- ✅ Same viewing experience as Library page

## User Flow Improvements

### Before
1. Submit job → Queue page
2. Wait (with misleading progress bar)
3. Job completes
4. Navigate to Library
5. Find your video
6. Watch it

### After
1. Submit job → Queue page
2. Wait (clean status indicator)
3. Job completes
4. **Video appears and auto-plays!** ✨
5. Watch immediately or go to Library for full management

## Technical Details

### Video Loading
- Uses `useEffect` to load video asset when job status is 'succeeded'
- Queries IndexedDB for assets matching the job ID
- Finds the video asset (kind === 'video')
- Creates blob URL for video player

### Video Player Features
- **Controls**: Play, pause, volume, fullscreen
- **Auto-play**: Starts playing automatically
- **Loop**: Repeats continuously
- **Responsive**: Full width of card
- **Rounded corners**: Matches design system

### Performance
- Only loads video for completed jobs
- Uses blob URLs (no network requests)
- Efficient IndexedDB queries

## Files Changed

1. ✅ `app/queue/page.tsx`
   - Removed progress bar
   - Added video asset loading
   - Added video player for completed jobs
   - Shows file name and size

## Build Status

```
✓ Build successful
✓ All pages compiled
✓ No errors
```

## Deploy

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "UX: Remove progress bar, show completed videos in queue"
git push
```

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

3. **Thumbnail preview**: Show thumbnail while loading
4. **Multiple videos**: Handle jobs that generate multiple variants
5. **Playback speed**: Control video speed
6. **Frame-by-frame**: Step through frames

### Not Needed Now
- Progress percentage (API doesn't provide it)
- Estimated time remaining (too variable)
- Queue position (API doesn't expose it)

## Testing

### Test Completed Job
1. Go to Queue page
2. Find a completed job
3. Video should display and auto-play
4. Controls should work (pause, volume, fullscreen)
5. File info should show below video

### Test Active Job
1. Submit a new job
2. Should show "Queued" status
3. No progress bar (clean look)
4. 🔄 button should work to force check
5. When complete, video appears automatically

**Status**: ✅ Ready to deploy!

The Queue page now provides immediate feedback and lets users watch their videos right away without navigating to the Library.

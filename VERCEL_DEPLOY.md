# Vercel Deployment - Fixed âœ…

## Issue Resolved

The deployment error was caused by a missing `public` directory. This has been fixed.

## What Was Fixed

1. âœ… Created `public` directory
2. âœ… Added `vercel.json` configuration
3. âœ… Added `robots.txt`
4. âœ… Removed invalid favicon
5. âœ… Build tested and passing

## Files Added

- `public/.gitkeep` - Ensures public directory is tracked
- `public/robots.txt` - SEO configuration
- `vercel.json` - Vercel deployment configuration

## Deploy Now

### Option 1: Push to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment - add public directory"
git push
```

Vercel will automatically redeploy.

### Option 2: Manual Deploy

```bash
vercel --prod
```

## Verify Deployment

After deployment:

1. âœ… Visit your Vercel URL
2. âœ… Check all pages load
3. âœ… Add API key in Settings
4. âœ… Test video generation

## Build Output

## Vercel Configuration

The `vercel.json` file ensures proper deployment:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": ".next",
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "installCommand": "npm install"
}
```

## Common Issues

### Still Getting Build Errors?

**Clear Vercel Cache**:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Project Settings â†’ General
3. Scroll to "Build & Development Settings"
4. Click "Clear Cache"
5. Redeploy

### Public Directory Not Found?

**Verify Files**:
```bash
ls -la public/
# Should show:
# .gitkeep
# robots.txt
```

### Build Succeeds but App Doesn't Work?

**Check Browser Console**:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Check Console tab for errors
3. Check Network tab for failed requests

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Commit and push changes
2. âœ… Wait for Vercel to redeploy
3. âœ… Test the deployed app
4. âœ… Add your API key
5. âœ… Start creating videos!

## Support

If you still have issues:

1. Check Vercel build logs
2. Verify all files are committed
3. Try clearing Vercel cache
4. Redeploy manually with `vercel --prod`

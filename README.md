# Sora Renderer

A local-first, privacy-focused web application for generating videos using OpenAI's Sora 2 and Sora 2 Pro models.

**Create stunning AI videos directly in your browser with complete privacy and control.**

Sora Renderer is a modern web application that lets you generate videos using OpenAI's powerful Sora 2 models. Unlike cloud-based solutions, all your data‚ÄîAPI keys, videos, and metadata‚Äîstays on your device. No servers, no tracking, no compromises.

- üîí **Privacy First**: All data (API keys, videos, metadata) stored locally in your browser
- üí∞ **Cost Estimator**: Real-time cost calculation before submitting jobs
- ‚è≥ **Job Queue**: Track rendering progress with automatic polling
- üìö **Local Library**: Manage your generated videos with search and filters
- üé® **Dark UI**: Beautiful, modern interface with glass-morphism design
- ‚ö° **Web Workers**: Background processing for polling and thumbnail generation

## Tech Stack

### Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

Vercel is the easiest and fastest way to deploy Sora Renderer. It's free for personal projects and takes just a few minutes.

#### Option 1: One-Click Deploy

Click this button to deploy directly to Vercel:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/TheMarco/sora-renderer)

This will:
1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account
2. Create a new Vercel project
3. Deploy the application automatically
4. Give you a live URL (e.g., `your-app.vercel.app`)

#### Option 2: Manual Deploy via CLI

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy from your local repository
vercel
```

Follow the prompts to link your project and deploy.

#### Option 3: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in
2. Click **"Add New Project"**
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Vercel will auto-detect Next.js settings
5. Click **"Deploy"**

#### Post-Deployment Setup

After deployment:

1. Visit your deployed URL
2. Click the **Settings** (‚öôÔ∏è) icon in the navigation
3. Enter your OpenAI API key
4. Start generating videos!

**Note**: Your API key is encrypted and stored only in your browser's local storage. It never touches Vercel's servers.

#### Vercel Configuration

No environment variables or build configuration needed! The app works out of the box on Vercel with:

- **Framework Preset**: Next.js
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` (auto-detected)
- **Output Directory**: `.next` (auto-detected)
- **Node Version**: 20.x (recommended)

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for advanced deployment options and troubleshooting.

### First-Time Setup

1. On first launch, you'll see a welcome modal
2. Navigate to Settings (‚öôÔ∏è icon in the top navigation)
3. Paste your OpenAI API key
4. The key will be encrypted and stored locally in your browser
5. Start creating videos!

## Usage

### Creating a Video

1. Go to **New Render**
2. Enter a detailed prompt describing your video
3. (Optional) Upload a reference image
4. Select model (Sora 2 or Sora 2 Pro)
5. Choose resolution and duration
6. Review the cost estimate
7. Click **Generate Video**

### Managing Jobs

## Security & Privacy

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Security Notes:**

- Your API key is encrypted using AES-GCM and stored in IndexedDB
- All data stays on your device - nothing is sent to any server except direct API calls to OpenAI
- Browser-based encryption is vulnerable if your device is compromised
- Consider using short-lived API keys or proxy tokens for additional security

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run type-check` - Run TypeScript type checking

## Pricing

Sora 2 and Sora 2 Pro pricing (as of implementation):

| Sora 2 | 1280√ó720 / 720√ó1280 | $0.10/sec |
| Sora 2 Pro | 1280√ó720 / 720√ó1280 | $0.30/sec |
| Sora 2 Pro | 1792√ó1024 / 1024√ó1792 | $0.50/sec |

## Limitations
